# 💳 ATM Simulation in Java

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple ATM simulation project I built using **core Java**. It’s a console-based program that lets you do basic ATM operations like checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing cash — just like a real ATM (but way simpler 😄).

---

## ✨ What It Can Do

- 🔐 Secure login with account number and PIN
- 💰 Check your account balance
- 📥 Deposit money
- 💸 Withdraw money
- 📋 Clean, menu-based interaction in the terminal

---

## 🧰 Tech I Used

- Java (no frameworks, just clean code)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java Collections (like `HashMap` for user storage)

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open your terminal in the project folder.
3. Compile and run it using:

```bash
javac ATM.java
java ATM

 Sample Login (for testing)
Account Number: 123456
PIN: 1234
